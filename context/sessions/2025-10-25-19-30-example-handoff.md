# Context Handoff: Example Handoff (Demo)

**From**: Claude-3.5-Sonnet → **To**: Codex  
**Date**: 2025-10-25 19:30  
**Estimated Effort**: 1 hour

---

## Summary (TL;DR)

**What**: Create example handoff file to demonstrate context transfer pattern  
**Why**: Sprint-001 Task 2 requires working example  
**When**: Completed as part of Task 2

---

## Current State

### What's Been Done:
- [x] Created `context/` directory structure
- [x] Written `context/README.md` with comprehensive guide
- [x] Created `context/handoff-template.md` with detailed template
- [x] Created this example file

### Key Decisions Made:
1. **Template Structure**: Chose comprehensive template over minimal - better for complex handoffs
2. **Naming Convention**: ISO date + time + kebab-case task name
3. **Status Tracking**: Included status field in frontmatter for automation

### Files Modified:
```
context/README.md              # Usage guide
context/handoff-template.md    # Template
context/sessions/.gitkeep      # Directory marker
```

---

## What Needs to Be Done

### Primary Task:
This is a demonstration file - no actual work required.

### In Real Handoff:
- [ ] Receiving AA reads and acknowledges handoff
- [ ] Receiving AA completes assigned tasks
- [ ] Receiving AA updates progress section
- [ ] Receiving AA marks handoff complete

### Acceptance Criteria:
- [x] Template demonstrates all required sections
- [x] Clear example for future handoffs
- [x] Documentation explains usage

---

## Context & Background

### Why This Work?
Sprint-001 Task 2 requires creating context handoff system for multi-AA collaboration.
This example demonstrates the pattern for future real handoffs.

### Previous Attempts:
N/A - First implementation

### Constraints:
- Must be clear and comprehensive
- Must follow LAW-EVIDENCE-TRACEABILITY
- Must integrate with existing tools (queue, evidence collector)

---

## Technical Details

### Key Files to Review:
```
context/README.md               # Full usage guide
context/handoff-template.md     # Copy this for new handoffs
```

### Environment:
```bash
cd /Users/tamld/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-MSFT/Documents/Github/mcp-poc-operations
# No special setup required
```

---

## Recommended Next Steps

### For Real Handoffs:
1. Copy `context/handoff-template.md` to `context/sessions/[date]-[task].md`
2. Fill in all sections (don't skip!)
3. Commit with message: `handoff(context): [from] → [to] for [task]`
4. Notify receiving AA (via moderator currently)
5. Receiving AA acknowledges within 2 hours
6. Receiving AA updates progress regularly
7. Mark complete when done

## Acknowledgment (Receiving AA)

**Note**: This is an example file - no actual acknowledgment needed.

In real handoff, receiving AA would:
- Add acknowledgment section
- Confirm understanding
- Ask clarifying questions
- Estimate completion time

---

## Completion (Receiving AA)

**Note**: This is an example file - marked as completed for demonstration.

**Completed By**: N/A (Example)  
**Date**: 2025-10-25 19:30  
**Purpose**: Demonstration of handoff pattern
