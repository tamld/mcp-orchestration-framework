## Reflection (LAW-REFLECT-001)
- Reviewed Claude’s technical analysis and the manual workflow optimization notes to ensure recommendations stay grounded in current PoC constraints.
- Considered operational failure modes (rate limits, auth drift, logging gaps) drawn from past DevOps runbooks.
- Balanced appetite for automation against the queue pattern that already works well and is token-efficient.

## Assessment Summary
- **Verdict**: MODIFY — API-based invocation is viable, but only as part of a hybrid pattern that keeps the Git queue as the orchestration backbone.
- **Rationale**: Direct API calls give speed, yet introduce new operational surfaces (keys, retries, observability) that we must plan for before declaring it “production-ready.”

## Operational Concerns & Mitigations
1. **Auth & Secrets Drift**
   - *Risk*: Multiple AA providers → scattered API keys, token rotation overhead.
   - *Mitigation*: Centralize secrets via env file + Vault/Keychain abstraction; ship helper script that loads provider creds from a single config and fails fast with descriptive errors.
2. **Quota & Rate Limits**
   - *Risk*: 50 req/min per provider can be exhausted during parallel brainstorms.
   - *Mitigation*: Implement token bucket limiter inside the helper; expose CLI flags (`--max-rps`, `--burst`) and persist metrics to a lightweight runtime log (`evidence/metrics/aa_invocation.csv`).
3. **Error Handling & Retries**
   - *Risk*: Network blips, 429s, provider outages cause silent failures.
   - *Mitigation*: Wrap API call in retry policy (exponential backoff, jitter), classify failures (client vs server), and log each attempt with correlation IDs stored alongside queue entry.
4. **Observability & Auditability**
   - *Risk*: Pure API path bypasses Git evidence and loses traceability.
   - *Mitigation*: Every invocation writes a durable record (`evidence/invocations/<timestamp>.jsonl`) that references the queue request + response file; include cost, duration, tokens.
5. **Developer Experience**
   - *Risk*: Raw API snippets scattered in scripts → inconsistent usage.
   - *Mitigation*: Provide `tools/aa_invoke.py` (or extend planned `mcpctl`) that encapsulates auth, retries, logging, and writes outputs back into the `context/from-<aa>.md` handoff.

## Recommended Pattern (Hybrid Queue + API Helper)
```
queue/request-to-<aa>.md  # remains SoT trigger
↓
User/automation runs: mcpctl invoke --aa codex --request queue/request-to-codex-...
↓
Helper script:
  1. Loads context files listed in request
  2. Calls provider API with retries & rate limiting
  3. Saves raw transcript to evidence/invocations/
  4. Generates draft idea file under ideas/<aa_id>/response-<slug>.md
  5. Updates queue status (JSON/YAML)
↓
Human review (fast sanity check)
↓
Commit via enhanced template referencing queue + evidence paths
```
- Keeps Git queue authoritative while letting us automate the heavy lifting of making the API call and assembling artefacts.

## Alternative Considered: Message Queue Broker
- **Pros**: Natural retry semantics, metrics, fan-out.
- **Cons**: Requires infrastructure (Redis/SQS), adds deployment footprint for PoC, duplicates Git audit trail.
- **Recommendation**: Defer until we outgrow Git+CLI approach; revisit post-PoC or when throughput > ~30 invocations/hour.

## Next Steps / Experiments
1. **Prototype Helper**: Extend planned `tools/capture_aa_session.sh` work to include `mcpctl invoke` command with configurable provider adapters.
2. **Rate Limit Test**: Simulate burst of 60 invocations using dry-run mode; verify limiter + logging behave correctly.
3. **Failure Injection**: Force 429/5xx responses and confirm retry policy surfaces errors + preserves evidence.
4. **DX Feedback Loop**: After helper MVP, dogfood with Codex/Gemini sessions and capture friction before scaling usage.
5. **Queue Schema Update**: Add optional `invocation_log` field pointing to evidence file so synthesis step stays traceable.

## Open Items for Synthesis
- Need Gemini’s take on cryptographic attribution to complement the operational controls.
- Moderator should decide when to flip from manual to helper-default mode (e.g., once scripts cover core safeguards).

> Feedback (codex @2025-10-25T16:10:27Z) [INFO]: Happy to partner on stub for `mcpctl invoke`; will upstream templates to the brainstorm playbook refresh session so all moderators inherit the pattern.
