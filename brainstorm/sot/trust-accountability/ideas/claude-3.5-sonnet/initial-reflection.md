## Idea

### LAW-REFLECT-001 Reflection
- **Context**: Need to design trust & accountability framework that is token-efficient
- **Current Problem**: Previous approach consumed excessive tokens with real-time verification
- **MCP-Server Compliance**: Must follow LAW-META-EXPLAINABILITY, LAW-EVIDENCE-TRACEABILITY, LAW-COLLAB-AA
- **User Need**: Lightweight solution that maintains trust without API overhead

### Core Principles for Token-Efficient Trust Framework

#### 1. Pre-Session Commitment Model
```yaml
Pre_Session_Commitment:
  - Single commitment statement at session start
  - Reference MCP-Server principles
  - No continuous verification overhead
  - User can reference commitment when needed
```

#### 2. On-Demand Verification
```yaml
On_Demand_Verification:
  - User requests verification only when needed
  - No automatic real-time monitoring
  - Minimal token usage
  - Focus on critical actions only
```

#### 3. Evidence-Based Approach
```yaml
Evidence_Standards:
  - Reference MCP-Server SoT for principles
  - Provide evidence only when requested
  - Use existing artifacts when possible
  - Avoid creating duplicate verification systems
```

#### 4. User Control Interface
```yaml
User_Controls:
  - Simple confirmation for critical actions
  - Evidence verification on-demand
  - Trust score summary (not real-time)
  - Violation alerts only when detected
```

### Implementation Strategy

#### Phase 1: Minimal Viable Framework
1. Create pre-session commitment template
2. Implement on-demand verification
3. Reference MCP-Server SoT
4. Simple user control interface

#### Phase 2: Evidence Integration
1. Link to MCP-Server principles
2. Create evidence collection on-demand
3. Implement violation detection
4. User feedback mechanism

#### Phase 3: Trust Building
1. Track trust metrics over time
2. Learn from violations
3. Improve commitment adherence
4. Build user confidence

### Expected Outcomes
- Token usage reduced by 80%
- Maintains trust and accountability
- User-friendly interface
- MCP-Server compliance
- Practical implementation

### Next Steps
- Invite other AAs to contribute ideas
- Refine approach based on feedback
- Create implementation plan
- Test with real scenarios
