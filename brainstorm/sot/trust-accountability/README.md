# Brainstorm Session: Trust & Accountability Framework

## Overview
- **Moderator**: tamld
- **Participants**: claude-3.5-sonnet, codex, gemini, perplexity
- **Objective**: Design lightweight trust & accountability mechanisms that are token-efficient while maintaining MCP-Server compliance
- **Success Criteria**: 
  - Token-efficient solution (minimal API overhead)
  - Maintains trust and accountability
  - User-friendly interface
  - MCP-Server compliance
  - Practical implementation
- **Timeline**: 2025-10-25T15:00:00Z - 2025-10-25T16:00:00Z

## Guardrails
- Do not include confidential customer data.
- Replace sensitive details with `REDACTED`.
- Follow LAW-REFLECT-001 before proposing actions.
- Cite relevant SoT entries (docs/policies) in each idea file.
- Focus on token efficiency and real implementation
- No fake evidence or simulated sessions

## Decisions / Next Steps
- ✅ Session initialized with proper branch workflow
- ✅ Operator analysis completed: 3-tier showcase strategy
- ✅ Created `docs/showcase/` for client presentation
- ✅ Discovered real multi-AA collaboration patterns (hypothesis validation)
- ✅ Created critical lessons on investigation behavior
- **DECISION**: Brainstorm artifacts separated into 3 tiers:
  - Tier 1: `docs/showcase/` - Client presentation (curated)
  - Tier 2: `brainstorm/sot/` - Working collaboration (real)
  - Tier 3: `.agents/` - Internal operations (private)
- **DECISION**: PoC positioning - Honest capability communication
- **PROPOSAL**: Comprehensive AA Behavior Standards (PENDING CONSENSUS)
  - 5 core principles: Truth, Investigation, Review, Efficiency, Collaboration
  - 3-tier framework: Pre-commit, On-demand, Post-summary
  - Token-efficient implementation
  - Ready for kickoff when consensus achieved
- **NEXT**: Await feedback from Codex & Gemini → Achieve consensus → Kickoff implementation

## Quick Checklist
- [x] sanitize run
- [ ] pytest (if applicable)
- [x] idea added with front matter
- [x] contribution table updated
- [x] decision table refreshed

## Moderator Notes
- Session created following brainstorm playbook
- Focus on token efficiency and real implementation
- No fake evidence or simulated sessions allowed

## What / So What / Now What
| Stage | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| What | Need to design lightweight trust & accountability framework |
| So What | Current approach consumes too many tokens, violates MCP-Server principles |
| Now What | Create real brainstorm session with proper artifacts and AA participation |

## Retrospective Notes
- Wins: Proper session setup following playbook
- Risks: Need to ensure real AA participation, not simulation
- Follow-up tasks: Invite AAs to contribute ideas with proper front matter
