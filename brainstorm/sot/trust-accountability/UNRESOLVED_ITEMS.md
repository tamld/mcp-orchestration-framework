## TL;DR: 5 ITEMS C·∫¶N QUY·∫æT ƒê·ªäNH

```yaml
CRITICAL (C·∫ßn quy·∫øt ƒë·ªãnh ngay):
  1. ADR template c√≥ add v√†o Phase 1A kh√¥ng? (t·ª´ feedback.md)
  2. Sprint structure c√≥ add v√†o Phase 1A kh√¥ng? (t·ª´ feedback.md)

  3. Automation timing criteria (when Phase 1 ‚Üí Phase 2?)
  4. Production architecture choice (post-PoC)
  5. Checklist link cho AA behavior standards

PoC_Scope: ‚úÖ APPROVED (Hybrid)
Implementation_Ready: ‚è≥ Pending moderator on items 1-2

## üî¥ CRITICAL: C·∫ßn Quy·∫øt ƒê·ªãnh Ngay (2 items)

### **1. ADR Template + Consensus Rules**

```yaml
Source: Feedback.md (Copilot recommendation)
Priority: TIER 1 Critical

Copilot_Says:
  "Need formal decision-making process"
  "AA behavior standards stuck at pending consensus"
  "No mechanism to resolve disagreements"

Recommendation:
  Add to Phase 1A (2 hours effort)

Components:
  - memory/templates/adr_template.md
  - docs/briefs/consensus_protocol.md
  - Basic consensus rules documented

Benefits:
  + Formalizes what we're already doing
  + Scales to more AAs
  + Clear decision lifecycle
  + Historical record of decisions

Trade-offs:
  - Extra 2 hours in Phase 1A
  - More process overhead (minimal)

Current_Status: NOT in Phase 1A plan
Consensus_Status: ‚ùå CH∆ØA QUY·∫æT ƒê·ªäNH
```

**Your Decision:**
- [ ] ‚úÖ YES - Add to Phase 1A
- [ ] ‚ùå NO - Defer to Phase 1B or 2
- [ ] ü§î MODIFY - What changes?

---

### **2. Sprint Structure + Tracking**

```yaml
Source: Feedback.md (Copilot recommendation)
Priority: TIER 1 Critical

Copilot_Says:
  "Excellent ideas kh√¥ng ƒë∆∞·ª£c execute"
  "No bridge t·ª´ brainstorm ‚Üí implementation"
  "Need execution framework"

Recommendation:
  Add to Phase 1A (2 hours effort)

Components:
  - plans/sprints/sprint-001-hybrid-poc/
  - Sprint plan.md with goals, tasks, acceptance criteria
  - Basic tracking structure (no automation yet)

Benefits:
  + Bridges brainstorm ‚Üí implementation gap
  + Execution accountability
  + Progress tracking
  + Foundation for future sprints

Trade-offs:
  - Extra 2 hours in Phase 1A
  - More structure (might slow initial velocity)

Current_Status: NOT in Phase 1A plan
Consensus_Status: ‚ùå CH∆ØA QUY·∫æT ƒê·ªäNH
```

**Your Decision:**
- [ ] ‚úÖ YES - Add to Phase 1A
- [ ] ‚ùå NO - Defer to Phase 1B or 2
- [ ] ü§î MODIFY - What changes?

## üü° MINOR: C√≥ Th·ªÉ Defer (3 items)

### **3. Automation Timing Criteria**

```yaml
Conflict:
  Claude: "Phase-based (Phase 1 manual, Phase 2 automate)"
  Codex: "Milestone-based (when safeguards proven)"

Not_Really_Conflict: Different emphasis

Current_Resolution:
  - Hybrid PoC approved (manual Phase 1A)
  - Automation deferred to Phase 1B/2
  - No urgent need to decide exact criteria NOW

Proposed_Resolution:
  Define criteria when approaching Phase 1 completion:
  1. PoC demonstrates value ‚úÖ
  2. Scripts cover auth, rate limits, retries ‚è≥
  3. Dogfooding completed successfully ‚è≥
  4. Moderator approves transition ‚è≥

Consensus_Status: ‚è≥ CAN DEFER (decide later)
Impact: LOW (doesn't block PoC)
```

**Your Decision:**
- [ ] ‚úÖ DEFER - Decide when Phase 1A nears completion
- [ ] ‚ùå DECIDE NOW - Set criteria: [your criteria]

---

### **4. Production Architecture Choice**

```yaml
Conflict:
  Gemini: "Dedicated Git Identities ideal for production"
  Codex: "Consider message queue broker post-PoC"

Not_Really_Conflict: Both are post-PoC considerations

Current_Resolution:
  - Hybrid PoC uses GPG + Attestation
  - Production architecture DEFERRED
  - Will decide after PoC validation

When_To_Decide:
  After PoC successfully demonstrates:
  1. Multi-AA coordination works
  2. Evidence quality sufficient
  3. Scalability needs clear
  4. Operational pain points identified

Consensus_Status: ‚è≥ DEFERRED (post-PoC)
Impact: NONE (PoC unaffected)
```

**Your Decision:**
- [ ] ‚úÖ DEFER - Revisit after PoC completion
- [ ] ‚ùå DECIDE NOW - Choose: [Dedicated Git IDs / Message Queue / Other]

---

### **5. Checklist Link for AA Behavior Standards**

```yaml
Request: Codex asked for explicit link to pre-flight checklist

Context:
  "Can we explicitly call out that the pre-session commitment
   should reference the pre-flight checklist we're drafting 
   in brainstorm-playbook-refresh?"

Resolution_Needed:
  Add cross-reference link in AA behavior standards proposal
  (trivial edit, 5 minutes)

Current_Status:
  aa-behavior-standards-proposal.md exists
  brainstorm-playbook-refresh has pre-flight checklist
  Just need to link them

Consensus_Status: ‚è≥ TRIVIAL (easy to resolve)
Impact: VERY LOW (cosmetic)
```

**Your Decision:**
- [ ] ‚úÖ YES - Add link now (5 min)
- [ ] ‚ùå NO - Not important
- [ ] ü§î DEFER - Add during implementation

---

## Summary: What Needs Your Decision?

### **Option A: Conservative (Original Plan)**
```yaml
Phase_1A:
  - GPG setup (2-3h)
  - Context structure (30min)
  - Commit template (15min)
  - Helper script (2-3h)

Total: 5-7 hours
Defer: ADR + Sprint to Phase 1B

Pros: Faster Phase 1A completion
Cons: Miss Copilot's critical recommendations
```

### **Option B: Enhanced (Recommended by Copilot)**
```yaml
Phase_1A:
  - GPG setup (2-3h)
  - Context structure (30min)
  - Commit template (15min)
  - Helper script (2-3h)
  - ADR template + rules (2h) üÜï
  - Sprint-001 structure (2h) üÜï

Total: 9-11 hours
Includes: Copilot's Tier 1 recommendations

Pros: Foundation for scaling, execution framework
Cons: More work upfront (still reasonable)
```

### **Option C: Minimal Add**
```yaml
Phase_1A:
  - Original items (5-7h)
  - ADR template only (2h) üÜï

Total: 7-9 hours
Defer: Sprint structure to Phase 1B

Pros: Balance foundation + speed
Cons: Still missing execution bridge
```

## Recommendation (Claude's Operator View)

```yaml
Recommended: Option B (Enhanced)

Why:
  1. Copilot's expert review identified these as CRITICAL
  2. Both are lightweight (just templates & docs)
  3. Both are foundational (not automation)
  4. 9-11 hours still doable in 1 week
  5. Prevents future bottlenecks

Copilot_Right_On:
  - "Ideas stuck without execution framework" ‚úÖ
  - "No formal decision process" ‚úÖ
  - Both are TIER 1 for scaling ‚úÖ

Risk_If_Not_Added:
  - More ideas die in brainstorm
  - Consensus bottlenecks repeat
  - Can't scale to more AAs efficiently
```
