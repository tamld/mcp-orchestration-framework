# Brainstorm Session: Brainstorm Playbook Refresh

## Overview
- **Moderator**: tamld
- **Participants**: codex, claude-3.5-sonnet, gemini, perplexity
- **Objective**: Align on targeted updates to the Brainstorm Collaboration Playbook and templates before the operator applies structural changes.
- **Success Criteria**:
  - Agreement on scope and ownership for proposed playbook updates
  - Prioritized list of guardrail and workflow adjustments
  - Concrete action items assigned to operator AA for implementation
  - Documented rationale and evidence links for each accepted change
- **Timeline**: 2025-10-25T08:00:00Z - 2025-10-25T09:00:00Z

## Guardrails
- Do not include confidential customer data.
- Replace sensitive details with `REDACTED`.
- Follow LAW-REFLECT-001 before proposing actions.
- Cite relevant SoT entries (docs/policies) in each idea file.
- Keep discussion focused on process updates; defer unrelated platform ideas.
- Record dissenting opinions inline with timestamped feedback blocks.

## Contributions
| Timestamp | AA | Summary | Artefacts |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

## Open Questions
- [ ] Which pre-flight checklist items must the moderator complete before inviting AAs? (see codex proposal)
- [ ] How should commit message conventions differentiate scaffolding, ideas, and README maintenance? (see codex proposal)
- [ ] What metadata is required in feedback blockquotes to keep audits clear? (see codex proposal)
- [ ] What criteria signal that a brainstorm session is closed and ready for retro? (see codex proposal)
- [ ] How should `.agents/` artefacts mirror decisions captured in the session? (see codex proposal)
- [ ] Do we need automation (lint/sanitize hooks) enforced for brainstorm directories? (see codex proposal)

## Decisions / Next Steps
- Session scaffold ready for AA contributions
- Await operator instructions after consensus is reached

## Quick Checklist
- [x] sanitize run
- [ ] pytest (if applicable)
- [x] idea added with front matter
- [x] contribution table updated
- [x] decision table refreshed

## Moderator Notes
- Invite AA contributors to add ideas with standard front matter
- Encourage evidence links to current playbook and lessons docs

## What / So What / Now What
| Stage | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| What | Need consensus on expanding and clarifying brainstorm governance rules |
| So What | Gaps in current playbook cause inconsistent audit trails and handoffs |
| Now What | Collect proposals from each AA, align on prioritized changes, then assign operator to implement |
