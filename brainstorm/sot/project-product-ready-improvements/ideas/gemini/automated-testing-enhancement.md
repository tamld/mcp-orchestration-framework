## Idea: Automated Testing Enhancement for Product Readiness

### Reflection (LAW-REFLECT-001)
- **Context:** The project is currently a Proof of Concept (PoC) with minimal existing test coverage, primarily focused on `test_registry.py`. The overarching goal is to transition this PoC into a product-ready state.
- **Assumption:** Comprehensive automated testing (unit, integration, and potentially end-to-end) is a fundamental and non-negotiable requirement for any software aiming for product-grade reliability, maintainability, and quality.
- **Decision:** Prioritize the expansion of automated test coverage to critical core modules of the framework.
- **Outcome:** This action is expected to significantly increase the system's reliability, improve its maintainability, and build greater confidence in its overall stability and correctness, which are all crucial for product readiness.

### Rationale
For the MCP Orchestration Framework to achieve a "product-ready" state, it requires a high degree of reliability and maintainability. Comprehensive automated testing is fundamental to achieving this. While the PoC currently has `test_registry.py`, expanding test coverage to core modules will ensure stability, prevent regressions, and facilitate future development.

### Impact on Product Readiness
- **Reliability:** Reduces the likelihood of bugs and unexpected behavior in a production environment, leading to a more stable system.
- **Maintainability:** Allows developers to refactor existing code and introduce new features with greater confidence, knowing that automated tests will catch unintended side effects.
- **Quality Assurance:** Provides objective and continuous evidence of code correctness and adherence to specifications.
- **Faster Development Cycles:** Automated tests provide quick feedback loops, allowing for rapid iteration and safer, more frequent deployments.

### Actionable Steps
1.  **Expand Unit Test Coverage for Core Pipeline Components:**
    -   Develop comprehensive unit tests for `src/mcp_poc_framework/pipeline/executor.py` to ensure the orchestration logic functions correctly under various scenarios.
    -   Develop comprehensive unit tests for `src/mcp_poc_framework/ssot/state_store.py` to validate its state management, persistence (if applicable), and data integrity.
    -   Develop comprehensive unit tests for `src/mcp_poc_framework/tasks/scheduler.py` to verify task selection, prioritization, and assignment logic.
2.  **Introduce Basic Integration Tests:**
    -   Implement integration tests to verify the seamless interaction and data flow between key modules, such as `scheduler` -> `executor` -> `state_store`. These tests should simulate typical operational workflows.
3.  **Integrate Test Execution into CI (as per G1 roadmap):**
    -   Ensure that all newly developed tests are automatically executed as part of the Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline, aligning with the G1 gate criteria mentioned in `tech_fit.yaml` and `README.md` (even if CI is currently disabled, planning for it is crucial).

## Feedback from Gemini (2025-10-25)

- **Agreement**: Agree
- **Rationale**: This proposal correctly identifies comprehensive automated testing as a non-negotiable requirement for product readiness. The breakdown into unit and integration tests for core components is logical and directly addresses the need for reliability and maintainability.
- **Suggestion**:
  - **Scope Expansion**: To make this even more robust, I suggest adding an actionable step: "4. Define Initial E2E Testing Strategy". This would involve outlining a plan for End-to-End tests to validate critical user-facing workflows, ensuring the system works as a whole.
