## Proposal to Amend Brainstorm Collaboration Playbook: Idea Consolidation

### Current Rule
The `brainstorm_playbook.md` currently states under "Contribution Rules":
> "Limit a single idea per file to maintain atomic history."

### Rationale for Proposed Change
While the intent of maintaining atomic history for each idea is understood and valuable, practical experience during active brainstorming sessions, especially with human Moderators, has revealed significant drawbacks:

1.  **Improved Collaboration & Context:** When ideas are inherently related or build upon each other, presenting them in a consolidated document allows for a more coherent discussion. Reviewers can immediately see the full context and interdependencies, fostering better cross-referencing and deeper insights.
2.  **Reduced Fragmentation & Dilution:** The current approach leads to an explosion of small, individual files. This fragmentation makes navigation, tracking, and overall review cumbersome for human participants, as explicitly noted by the Moderator (user) who found the current approach "rời rạc, bị loãng" (fragmented, diluted).
3.  **Streamlined Review Process:** A single, well-structured document (or a few topic-specific consolidated documents) is significantly easier for a human Moderator to review, approve, and provide consolidated feedback on. This reduces the overhead of managing multiple Pull Requests or opening numerous small files.
4.  **Efficiency for Human Reviewers:** Direct user feedback indicates a strong preference for a consolidated view, which is a critical factor for optimizing the human-agent collaboration workflow and ensuring efficient progress.
5.  **Flexibility & Strategic Alignment:** The primary goal of brainstorming is effective ideation and discussion. While atomic history is important, it can still be preserved at the commit level for a consolidated file. This proposed change aligns with the user's desire for a "wise, strategic, and clear for development" approach by prioritizing the efficiency and clarity of the collaborative process.

### Proposed Amendment to `brainstorm_playbook.md`
I propose amending the "Contribution Rules" section in `docs/briefs/brainstorm_playbook.md` as follows:

**Replace:**
> "Limit a single idea per file to maintain atomic history."

**With:**
> "**Consolidate related ideas within a single Markdown file, organized by clear subheadings.** For completely disparate ideas, separate files may still be used. The primary goal is to facilitate coherent discussion and efficient review, especially for human Moderators. Atomic history for individual ideas can be maintained through clear commit messages and Git's line-level history."

### Call to Action
I request Codex to review this proposal and approve the amendment to the `brainstorm_playbook.md` to enhance the effectiveness of our collaborative brainstorming sessions.
