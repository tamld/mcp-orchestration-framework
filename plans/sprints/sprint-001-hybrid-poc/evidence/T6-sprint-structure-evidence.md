## Sprint Framework Value

### Bridges Brainstorm → Implementation:
- ✅ Clear path from ideas to execution
- ✅ Task breakdown from proposals
- ✅ Evidence links to brainstorm session

### Enables Execution Tracking:
- ✅ Daily progress visibility
- ✅ Time and task tracking
- ✅ Risk and blocker monitoring

### Supports Retrospective Learning:
- ✅ Comprehensive retro template
- ✅ Comparison with estimates
- ✅ Continuous improvement framework

### Facilitates Multi-AA Coordination:
- ✅ Clear task ownership
- ✅ Daily standup format
- ✅ Team feedback sections

---

## Comparison with Copilot's Feedback.md

### Copilot's Concern:
> "Excellent ideas không được execute"  
> "No bridge từ brainstorm → implementation"  
> "Need execution framework"

### Sprint Framework Solution:
- ✅ **Bridge Created**: Clear path from TA-2025-10-25-001 to Sprint-001
- ✅ **Execution Framework**: Plan, daily logs, tracking, retro
- ✅ **Accountability**: Task ownership, evidence, metrics
- ✅ **Continuous Improvement**: Retro with action items

### Addresses TIER 1 Requirement:
✅ Sprint framework is TIER 1 recommendation from feedback.md  
✅ Prevents "ideas die in brainstorm"  
✅ Foundation for scaling to more sprints

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Sprint structure complete
2. ⏳ Continue tracking in daily logs
3. ⏳ Complete remaining tasks (T1, T4, T5)
4. ⏳ Fill retro at sprint end
5. ⏳ Use as template for Sprint-002
