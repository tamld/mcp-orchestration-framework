## README.md Features

### Documentation Sections:
- ✅ Directory structure explanation
- ✅ When to use / when not to use
- ✅ How to create a handoff (quick start)
- ✅ Best practices (sending/receiving AA)
- ✅ Workflow diagram (mermaid)
- ✅ Example scenarios (3 detailed examples)
- ✅ Integration with other tools

## Template Features

### Template Sections:
```yaml
Metadata (YAML frontmatter):
  - handoff_id, from_aa, to_aa
  - task, created, status, priority

Content Sections:
  1. Summary (TL;DR)
  2. Current State (what's done)
  3. What Needs to Be Done (tasks)
  4. Context & Background (why)
  5. Technical Details (how)
  6. What I Tried (debugging)
  7. Recommended Next Steps
  8. Evidence & References
  9. Questions for Receiving AA
  10. Progress Tracking
  11. Acknowledgment
  12. Completion
  13. Retrospective
```

### Template Completeness:
- ✅ All required fields documented
- ✅ Examples and placeholders provided
- ✅ Status tracking integrated
- ✅ Evidence traceability built-in
- ✅ Acknowledgment workflow included

---

## Example Handoff File

**Purpose**: Demonstrates real usage of template

**File**: `context/sessions/2025-10-25-19-30-example-handoff.md`

**Demonstrates**:
- ✅ Proper frontmatter format
- ✅ All sections filled with realistic content
- ✅ Task references (Sprint-001, Task 2)
- ✅ Evidence links
- ✅ Status tracking
- ✅ Completion workflow

---

## Integration Points

### With Brainstorm Queue:
```
Queue: Async request/response for ideas
Handoff: Sync work transfer for execution
Use both: Queue for decisions, Handoff for implementation
```

### With Evidence Collector:
```
Handoff references evidence files
Evidence collector captures before/after handoff
Both ensure traceability
```

### With GPG Signing:
```
All commits referencing handoff signed
Proves authorship of handoff steps
Audit trail for multi-AA work
```
