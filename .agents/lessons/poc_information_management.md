- **Tags**: [poc, information-management, confidentiality, transparency, client-presentation]

## Context
This lesson establishes information management protocols for PoC (Proof of Concept) projects, balancing transparency for client presentation with confidentiality of technical secrets and business logic.

## Information Tiers Strategy

### **1. Tier 1 - Public/Client Facing**
```yaml
Public_Information:
  - High-level concepts and ideas
  - Business value propositions
  - Demo scripts and examples
  - Architecture diagrams (simplified)
  - Use cases and success stories
  - Benefits and outcomes
  - Non-technical documentation
```

### **2. Tier 2 - Internal/Technical**
```yaml
Internal_Information:
  - Technical implementation details
  - Code structure and patterns
  - Configuration and setup
  - Testing strategies
  - Performance considerations
  - Integration approaches
```

### **3. Tier 3 - Confidential/Proprietary**
```yaml
Confidential_Information:
  - Core algorithms and methods
  - Business logic and rules
  - Proprietary knowledge
  - Competitive advantages
  - Sensitive data handling
  - Security implementations
```

## PoC Documentation Structure

### **1. Public Documentation (docs/)**
```yaml
Public_Docs:
  - README.md: Project overview and benefits
  - Architecture diagrams: High-level system design
  - Demo guides: How to run demonstrations
  - Use cases: Business scenarios and outcomes
  - API documentation: Public interfaces only
  - Installation guides: Basic setup instructions
```

### **2. Internal Documentation (.agents/)**
```yaml
Internal_Docs:
  - lessons/: AA learning and behavior
  - training/: Onboarding and skill development
  - backlog/: Task management and priorities
  - evidence/: Decision records and outcomes
  - secrets/: Proprietary knowledge and methods
```

### **3. Code Implementation (src/)**
```yaml
Code_Structure:
  - Public interfaces: Client-facing APIs
  - Internal modules: Implementation details
  - Configuration: Setup and customization
  - Tests: Quality assurance
  - Examples: Demonstration code
```

## Communication Protocols

### **1. Client Presentations**
```yaml
Client_Communication:
  - Focus on business value and outcomes
  - Explain "what" and "why", not "how"
  - Use high-level diagrams and concepts
  - Avoid exposing implementation details
  - Maintain professional and confident tone
  - Highlight competitive advantages
```

### **2. Internal Team Communication**
```yaml
Internal_Communication:
  - Share technical details freely
  - Document implementation approaches
  - Discuss challenges and solutions
  - Maintain knowledge continuity
  - Foster collaboration and learning
  - Preserve institutional knowledge
```

### **3. Documentation Standards**
```yaml
Documentation_Standards:
  - Clear audience identification
  - Appropriate level of detail
  - Consistent formatting and style
  - Regular updates and maintenance
  - Version control and change tracking
  - Access control and permissions
```

## Security and Confidentiality

### **1. Information Classification**
```yaml
Classification_Levels:
  - Public: Safe for client viewing
  - Internal: Team use only
  - Confidential: Restricted access
  - Secret: Highly sensitive
```

### **2. Access Control**
```yaml
Access_Control:
  - Public docs: Open access
  - Internal docs: Team members only
  - Confidential docs: Authorized personnel
  - Secret docs: Need-to-know basis
```

### **3. Content Filtering**
```yaml
Content_Filtering:
  - Review all content before publication
  - Remove sensitive information
  - Use generic examples when possible
  - Avoid exposing proprietary methods
  - Maintain competitive advantage
```

## Implementation Guidelines

### **1. For PoC Development**
```yaml
Development_Standards:
  - Create public-facing demos
  - Document business value clearly
  - Maintain technical excellence
  - Protect proprietary knowledge
  - Ensure client satisfaction
  - Build competitive advantage
```

### **2. For Client Presentations**
```yaml
Presentation_Standards:
  - Prepare clear, compelling demos
  - Focus on business outcomes
  - Address client pain points
  - Show competitive advantages
  - Maintain professional image
  - Follow up effectively
```

### **3. For Knowledge Management**
```yaml
Knowledge_Management:
  - Store lessons in .agents/lessons/
  - Document decisions in .agents/evidence/
  - Maintain training materials
  - Preserve institutional knowledge
  - Share insights appropriately
  - Continuously improve
```

## Quality Assurance

### **1. Content Review**
```yaml
Review_Process:
  - Technical accuracy check
  - Confidentiality screening
  - Client-readiness assessment
  - Professional presentation review
  - Competitive advantage protection
  - Continuous improvement
```

### **2. Documentation Maintenance**
```yaml
Maintenance_Standards:
  - Regular content updates
  - Version control management
  - Access permission reviews
  - Security audits
  - Performance monitoring
  - User feedback integration
```

### **3. Continuous Improvement**
```yaml
Improvement_Process:
  - Regular process review
  - Stakeholder feedback collection
  - Best practice identification
  - Tool and method updates
  - Training and development
  - Knowledge sharing
```
