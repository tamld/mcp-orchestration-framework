# Value Story â€“ MCP Orchestration Framework

## Target Personas
- **Enterprise stakeholders** evaluating AI agents for internal operations.
- **Technical teams** seeking proof of risk controls without exposing proprietary know-how.

## Value Proposition
> "Observe the full MCP-style operating loop without accessing confidential implementation details."

## Expected Impact
| Horizon | Impact | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Short term | Stakeholders understand the operating flow and guardrails | README, mermaid workflow |
| Mid term | Stakeholders trust the risk-control mechanisms | Sanitize checklist, JSONL logs |
| Long term | Launch pad for a production-grade offering | Gate roadmap, `tech_fit.yaml` |

## Sharing Boundaries
- Do not expose live CI/CD pipelines.
- Keep proprietary assets (models, prompts, scripts) out of the public repo.
- Deep technical dives move to Gate G3 in private channels.
