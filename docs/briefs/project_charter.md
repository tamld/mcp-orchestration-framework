# MCP Orchestration Framework – Project Charter

## Vision
Deliver a trusted control plane that lets human teams and AI agents collaborate safely across projects, turning reflection-driven learning into a repeatable competitive advantage.

## Mission
Provide a modular orchestration framework that bootstraps from a Single Source of Truth (SoT), enforces guardrails by design, and proves its value through measurable learning quality within 90 days of adoption.

## Strategic Goals
| Horizon | Goal | Outcome Target |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0–3 months (PoC) | Validate workflow & guardrails with pilot customer | Gate G0–G2 complete, positive demo feedback, zero confidential leaks |
| 3–6 months (Alpha) | Launch API surface + durable SSoT | FastAPI gateway, relational storage with audit logs, automated sanitize CI |
| 6–12 months (Beta) | Introduce human-in-loop dashboard & policy automation | Dashboard MVP, OPA/Cedar guardrail integration, NPS ≥ 8 |

## Guiding Principles
1. **Human partnership first** – the framework augments, not replaces, expert judgment.
2. **Evidence before promotion** – every lesson or update must cite artefacts (logs, contracts, reviews).
3. **Composable architecture** – keep components replaceable (storage, adapters, UI) to fit varied customer stacks.
4. **Cost-aware scaling** – optimize for minimal token/API spend during PoC while paving the way for enterprise-grade usage.

## Customer Value Proposition
- Transparent learning loop: stakeholders see how agents reflect, escalate, and improve.
- Governance baked in: LAW-REFLECT-001, sanitize workflows, and audit-friendly formats reduce compliance risk.
- Rapid integration path: library + CLI can plug into existing pipelines; future API/UI layers are planned.

## Success Metrics
| Metric | Definition | Target (PoC) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Reflection adoption | % of tasks passing LAW-REFLECT-001 checklist | ≥ 95% |
| Sanitization quality | # of critical leaks detected post-checklist | 0 |
| Lesson reuse delta | # of times STM lessons applied before promotion to LTM | ≥ 3 per lesson |
| Stakeholder confidence | Customer rating of transparency & control (1–10) | ≥ 8 |

## Risks & Mitigations
| Risk | Description | Mitigation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Scope creep | Customers push for production features too early | Gate governance & roadmap transparency |
| Cost overrun | API spend exceeds PoC budget | Token budget tracker + dry-run defaults |
| Adoption gap | Teams struggle to follow SoT rituals | Provide templates, coaching, and automated reminders |

## Roadmap Snapshot (next 90 days)
1. Finalise PoC artefacts (charter, case study, KPI dashboards).  
2. Implement FastAPI read-only endpoints for SSoT snapshots.  
3. Pilot automated evaluation suite for agent reflections.  
4. Prepare investor/partner pitch deck and budget.

## Resource & Support Needs
- **Mentorship**: product advisor to review roadmap and positioning.  
- **Infrastructure**: staging environment for durable SSoT (Postgres or equivalent) by month 3.  
- **Budget**: seed allocation for API usage & observability tooling (OpenTelemetry collector, hosted dashboards).

## Stakeholder Map
| Role | Owner | Responsibilities |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Product Lead | tamld | Vision, roadmap, customer engagement |
| Technical Lead | Codex (AI partner) | Architecture, implementation, documentation |
| Pilot Customer | TBD | Feedback, demo validation, requirements |
| Governance Advisor | TBD (mentor) | Policy review, compliance alignment |

## Approval & Review Cadence
- Charter review every 30 days or upon major scope change.  
- Gate reviews aligned with roadmap milestones.  
- Monthly executive summary delivered to stakeholders post-G2.
