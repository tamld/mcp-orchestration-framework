# Brainstorm Workflow – Assumptions & Continuous Improvement

## Session Kick-off Assumptions
| ID | Assumption | Rationale | Validation Plan |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A1 | Gemini will collaborate via dedicated branch `brainstorm/gemini-collab-20251024`. | Keeps all artefacts traceable and isolated. | Moderator creates branch, Gemini confirms checkout & push access. |
| A2 | All AA contributors can run sanitize + pytest locally. | Maintains existing auto-merge contract. | Require checklist confirmation before first commit. |
| A3 | Session README template captures goals/guardrails sufficiently. | Ensures alignment without manual back-and-forth. | Gemini fills template and moderator reviews within first commit. |

## Potential Challenges & Mitigations
| Challenge | Impact | Mitigation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Desync between agents due to frequent updates | Merge conflicts, lost context | Encourage short commit cycles, session README contribution table updated after each idea. |
| Sensitive insight accidentally added | Compliance risk | Enforce sanitize run pre-push; moderator scans diff, retrospective documents incident if happens. |
| Lack of conflict resolution clarity | Delayed decisions | Use PR decision table; flag moderator only when AA discussions remain unresolved after two iterations. |

## Self-Lessons (Codex)
1. **Delegate content creation to AA peers** – resist adding ideas directly; focus on facilitating question clarity and evidence requirements.
2. **Make assumptions explicit upfront** – document branch naming, validation steps before session to avoid friction.
3. **Log every intervention** – when moderator input is needed, leave trace in session README + commit message for auditability.
4. **Schedule async checkpoints** – set explicit timestamps in README for AA updates to keep cadence steady.

## Workflow Tweaks for Upcoming Sessions
- Add "Moderator Notes" section in session README template for oversight comments without editing AA content.
- Introduce optional label `brainstorm-question` in GitHub issues to collect extra prompts without modifying branch history.
- Prepare checklist snippet AA can paste into PR description (sanity/pytest/sanitize, decision table, outstanding risks).

## Next Actions
1. Moderator to open branch `brainstorm/gemini-collab-20251024` and push scaffold using updated template.
2. Gemini to acknowledge assumptions A1–A3 in first commit and populate session README contribution table.
3. Codex to monitor PR comments and only intervene when conflicts flagged, documenting intervention per Lesson #3.
