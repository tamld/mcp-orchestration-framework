## Context

During the Trust & Accountability brainstorm session (TA-2025-10-25-001), we identified the need for standardized behavior guidelines for all AI agents (AAs) working within the MCP Orchestration Framework. Without clear behavioral standards, AAs may operate inconsistently, leading to confusion, inefficiency, and potential conflicts.

### What is the issue that we're seeing that is motivating this decision or change?
Multi-AA collaboration requires consistent behavior patterns to ensure effective coordination, clear communication, and reliable outcomes. Currently, each AA operates with different assumptions and approaches, leading to coordination overhead and potential misunderstandings.

### What is the impact if we don't do this?
- Inconsistent AA behavior across sessions
- Increased coordination overhead
- Potential conflicts and misunderstandings
- Difficulty scaling to more AAs
- Reduced trust and reliability

### What is the impact if we do this?
- Standardized, predictable AA behavior
- Improved multi-AA coordination
- Clear expectations for all participants
- Foundation for scaling to more AAs
- Enhanced trust and reliability

### What is the impact if we do this later?
- Continued inconsistency and coordination overhead
- Missed opportunity to establish patterns early
- More difficult to change established behaviors

---

## Decision

We will implement a comprehensive AA Behavior Standards framework based on 5 core principles and a 3-tier implementation approach.

### We will:
- Adopt 5 core behavioral principles (Truth & Transparency, Thorough Investigation, Resource Review First, Token Efficiency, Collaboration & Feedback)
- Implement 3-tier framework (Pre-Session Commitment, On-Demand Verification, Post-Session Summary)
- Create enforcement mechanisms and evidence collection
- Establish continuous improvement processes

### We will not:
- Create overly rigid rules that stifle creativity
- Implement without evidence collection
- Skip the phased rollout approach

---

## Consequences

### Positive
- Consistent, predictable AA behavior
- Improved multi-AA coordination efficiency
- Clear expectations and accountability
- Foundation for scaling to more AAs
- Enhanced trust and reliability
- Reduced coordination overhead

### Negative
- Initial overhead to learn and adopt standards
- Potential resistance to change
- Additional documentation requirements

### Risks
- **Over-engineering**: Mitigation - Keep standards practical and focused
- **Inconsistent adoption**: Mitigation - Phased rollout with evidence collection
- **Stifling creativity**: Mitigation - Focus on principles, not rigid rules

### Unknowns
- How quickly AAs will adopt the standards
- Impact on creative problem-solving
- Long-term maintenance requirements

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: No Standards
- **Description**: Continue with current ad-hoc approach
- **Pros**: No overhead, maximum flexibility
- **Cons**: Inconsistent behavior, coordination problems
- **Why rejected**: Doesn't address identified problems

### Alternative 2: Minimal Guidelines
- **Description**: Basic principles only, no enforcement
- **Pros**: Low overhead, some consistency
- **Cons**: May not be sufficient for scaling
- **Why rejected**: Insufficient for multi-AA coordination

### Alternative 3: Rigid Rules
- **Description**: Detailed, prescriptive behavioral rules
- **Pros**: Maximum consistency
- **Cons**: Stifles creativity, difficult to maintain
- **Why rejected**: Too restrictive for diverse AA capabilities

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)
- [x] Create behavior standards proposal
- [x] Achieve consensus through brainstorm
- [x] Document in ADR
- [ ] Create enforcement checklist

### Phase 2: Rollout (Week 2-3)
- [ ] Implement in current sessions
- [ ] Collect evidence of adoption
- [ ] Gather feedback from AAs
- [ ] Refine based on experience

### Phase 3: Integration (Week 4+)
- [ ] Integrate with sprint planning
- [ ] Add to onboarding process
- [ ] Create monitoring dashboard
- [ ] Regular review and updates

### Success Criteria
- [ ] All AAs acknowledge standards
- [ ] Evidence of consistent behavior
- [ ] Positive feedback from moderators
- [ ] Reduced coordination overhead

### Rollback Plan
If standards prove problematic:
1. Revert to previous ad-hoc approach
2. Document lessons learned
3. Propose revised approach
4. Re-consensus through brainstorm
